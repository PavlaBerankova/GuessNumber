# Guess Number Mobile App

Guess Number is a simple mobile application developed in SwiftUI for iOS. It allows the user to play a number guessing game with two difficulty levels: easy and hard. In the easy level, the player has 10 attempts to guess the hidden number, while in the hard level, they only have 5 attempts.


- Version control with three branches: `main`, `version.2`, and `features`.

## Branches

- `main`: This branch contains the initial version of the application, representing the first mobile app I developed using SwiftUI.
- `version.2`: This branch features an enhanced version of the application with improved code organization, better structuring for easier maintenance and future changes, and a completely redesigned user interface.
- `features`: The `features` branch focuses on adding additional functionality and further improving the application. Changes will be implemented through pull requests.

## What this project taught me

- enum: The model for this application is implemented using an enum instead of a struct to exercise the usage of enums.
- init(): Custom initialization. The background of the application changes dynamically based on the selected difficulty level.

## How to Download and Test the App

To download and test the Guess Number app on your local machine using GitHub and Xcode, follow these steps:

1. Install Xcode on your Mac. You can download Xcode from the Mac App Store or from the Apple Developer website.

2. Open Terminal on your Mac and go (create) to the folder to which you want to clone the project

3. Clone the Guess Number repository by running the following command:

4. Open the project in Xcode, select a simulator from the device menu or connect your physical iOS device.

5. Build and run the application by clicking the "Play" button or pressing `Cmd + R`.

6. The Guess Number app will launch in the simulator or on your connected iOS device, allowing you to play the game and test its features.

Have fun playing Guess Number!
