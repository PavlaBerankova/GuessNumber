# **GUESS THE NUMBER APP**
## I converted my older project: Guess the number in CommandLine, into a mobile app

You choose two difficulty levels (Easy and Hard) and the number of attempts will be set accordingly. The game generates a secret number within the range of 1 to 100 and the player tries to guess the number. After entering the number, the result will be displayed in a notification.
