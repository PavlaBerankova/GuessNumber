# **ðŸŽ²  GUESS THE NUMBER APP**

## This project has 2 branches:

### 
**VERSION.2** - in this branch you will find an improved version of the application - changed code and logic, but also the UI.

- You choose two difficulty levels (Easy and Hard) and the number of attempts will be set accordingly. The game generates a secret number within the range of 1 to 100 and the player tries to guess the number. After entering the number, the result will be displayed in a notification.
